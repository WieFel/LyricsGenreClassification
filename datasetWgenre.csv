201,Aerosmith,Shut Up And Dance,"Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance  
Love has got me down  
The weight is all around  
So you lend a hand to peace on earth  
Here's my piece, now what's it worth  
Yea, but it's all right  
When you can't define the crime  
Then life ain't worth a dime  
When they take away everything you got  
And they rub your nose in the funky spot  
Not without a fight  
When you work your fingers to the bone  
And what does that get you--nothing  
If in a crowd of people  
You're still alone I hope that tells you something  
The road to heaven is paved in hell  
And it makes you wonder  
Why you're here at all  
Check out the shape of your circumstance  
He wears the dress and she wears the pants  
Here comes Jill and she needs romance  
But you can't do jack so shut up and dance!  
Sex is like a gun  
You aim, you shoot, you run  
When you're splittin' hairs with Mr. Clean  
It' like gettin' head from a guillotine  
And the night has just begun  
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

202,Aerosmith,Sick As A Dog,"Please, I just got to talk to you  
Please, well keep your head out of the loo  
Please, we're a long, long way from home  
Please, you'd turn a young man's face to stone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sick as a dog, what's your story  
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue  
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry  
Sick as a dog, 'cause you're really ain't that young  
  
Please, you were much to my surprise  
Please, you're a lady in disguise  
Please, you're the only friend I got  
Please, you're the last to see me rot  
  
Please, it's a shame you're so refined  
Please, she was the last thing on my mind  
Please, don't be late to take it light  
Please, you're gonna bay into the night  
  
Say goodnight

203,Aerosmith,Sight For Sore Eyes,"Goin' downtown, goin' down, goin' down  
'neath the city, eatin' ground round  
Underground is pretty gritty  
I turned the screw she held the light  
That's when I knew she was a  
  
Sight for sore eyes  
She was a sight for sore eyes  
  
Playin' no fair, sleepin' under stairs  
Downtown's a pity, takin' fair square  
Under where it's pretty gritty  
I turned the screw, she held the knife  
  
Oh, holy jesus, she's a sight for sore eyes  
Sight for sore eyes  
She's a nitty grutty  
  
Turnin' in style, walk a mile for your titty  
Naked foul while under there  
Under where it's pretty gritty  
Hey, don't you know people  
She's a love lust hussy  
She left, oh she rust me  
Dear old girl  
She was a sight for sore eyes  
But she was sittin' pretty  
A sight for sore eyes  
She was a nitty gritty  
Sight for sore eyes  
  
Peeled back and parted  
Even at the start it was delight or demise  
I feel like a leopard king  
Sight for sore eyes  
She was a sight for sore eyes

204,Aerosmith,Somebody,"I need a lady, not somebody shady  
Need someone to be close to  
Somebody cozy, not somebody nosey  
Help me see my whole day through  
  
Someone to share the load  
Somebody to walk the road I live on, live  
  
Good Lord send me, good Lord mend me  
Send me down someone for me  
Said I won't be choosy  
You could send me a floosy  
Send me anybody you please  
Somebody say you will  
Somebody further still  
Somebody, some, somebody for me  
Now won't you send me somebody  
Yeah, somebody  
  
Won't you send me somebody  
Now won't you send me somebody  
Well, call for somebody  
Scream loud and bloody  
Call woman, woman, come on to me  
Save for tomorrow  
Share all your sorrow  
Misery enjoys company  
Yes it does, yes it does
